## About the project
### Context 
Any Manufacturing Company is a medium-sized manufacturing firm that produces electronic components. They have a wide range of products and maintain an inventory of raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), and finished goods. The company has been experiencing issues with inventory management, including stockouts, excess inventory, and increased carrying costs. The management team wants to conduct an inventory analysis to identify areas for improvement and optimize their inventory management practices.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of the inventory analysis are as follows:

- Determine the optimal inventory levels for raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), and finished goods.
- Identify opportunities to reduce stockouts and excess inventory.
- Analyze inventory turnover and carrying costs to optimize working capital.
- Streamline procurement and production processes to improve efficiency.
- Develop a sustainable inventory management strategy for future growth.

### Available Data

The following data will be utilized for the inventory analysis:

- **Inventory Records**: Detailed records of all inventory transactions, including purchases, production, sales, and adjustments.
- **Demand Data**: Historical sales data for various products.
- **Lead Time Data**: Information on the time required to receive raw materials and produce finished goods.
- **Cost Data**: Information on the costs of raw materials, production, and carrying costs.

### Tasks

To address the objectives, the following tasks need to be performed:

- **Demand Forecasting:** Analyze historical sales data to accurately forecast future demand for different products.
- **ABC Analysis:** Classify inventory items based on their value and importance to prioritize management efforts.
- **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Analysis:** Determine the optimal order quantity for raw materials to minimize ordering and transportation costs.
- **Reorder Point Analysis:** Calculate the reorder point for each product to avoid stockouts.
- **Lead Time Analysis:** Evaluate the lead time for raw materials and production to optimize inventory levels.
- **Transportation Cost Analysis:** Calculate maintenance costs associated with inventory to identify areas for cost reduction.
- **Process Improvement:** Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in procurement and production processes and suggest improvements.
- **Inventory Turnover Analysis:** Calculate inventory turnover ratios to assess the efficiency of inventory management.

### Deliverables

Based on the analysis, the following deliverables will be provided:

- **Optimal Inventory Levels:** Recommendations for optimal inventory levels of raw materials, WIP, and finished goods.
- **Reorder Point and EOQ Calculations:** Reorder points and economic order quantities for each product to minimize stockouts and costs.
- **Process Improvement Recommendations:** Suggestions for streamlining procurement and production processes to enhance efficiency.
- **Inventory Turnover Analysis:** Assessment of inventory turnover ratios and recommendations for improving working capital efficiency.
- **Inventory Management Strategy:** Development of a comprehensive inventory management strategy for AstraNova Manufacturing Company.

By conducting this inventory analysis, AstraNova Manufacturing Company aims to improve its inventory management practices, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring product availability.
